## [Project Goals]
The main goal of this project is to enable users with low information literacy to build and manage systems on low-code platforms like kintone without requiring any specialized knowledge.
We aim to create a tool that leverages AI to automate app creation, customization, and data processing for low-code tools, allowing users to perform these tasks simply by providing instructions in natural language.

## [Features]
Here are some of the key features we're planning to implement in this project:
1. Automatic app creation: Streamline the process of building apps on low-code platforms by leveraging AI capabilities.
2. Automatic data processing: Simplify data manipulation tasks using AI, minimizing manual effort and reducing the chances of human error.
3. Utilization of external data and external storage: Enable seamless integration with external data sources and storage solutions to expand the potential use cases and improve overall system performance.
4. Execution of complex tasks using technologies like LangChain: Facilitate the handling of intricate tasks by incorporating advanced language processing tools, further enhancing the capabilities of our AI-driven solution.

## [Technologies]
This project is built using the following technologies:
Language: JavaScript
Framework: React
Database: kintone
